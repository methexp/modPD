## Results

As in Experiment 1, we first report the results of a manipulation check (i.e., the effects of the experimental valence manipulations on evaluative ratings).
Next, we analyzed the responses on the TBS task.
In the Appendix, we report additional results on the proportions of Memory- and Attitude-set judgments and on valence memory accuracy in each response set.

### Evaluative conditioning

To examine EC effects, pre-post evaluative changes were entered into an ANOVA with all of the experimental factors.
Figures \@ref(fig:ec2face) (face CSs) and \@ref(fig:ec2gogo) (toy CSs) illustrate pre-post evaluative change as a function of CS Valence and US valence.

We found robust US valence effects, `r ec2_$full_result$US_Valence`.
Compared with nonpaired stimuli, pairing with pleasant USs clearly increased liking, `r apa_print(ec2p)$full_result$US_Valence`, whereas the reduction by unpleasant USs was considerably smaller,  `r apa_print(ec2n)$full_result$US_Valence`.

We also found a strong regression-to-the-mean artifact for pre-experimentally valent CSs (i.e., CSs selected because they were initially most negative were later evaluated more positively; and vice versa), `r ec2_$full_result$CS_Valence`.
Interactions with Material indicated that both effects were stronger for toy figures than faces (CS Valence: `r ec2_$full_result$Material_CS_Valence`; US Valence: `r ec2_$full_result$Material_US_Valence`).
While the increase in liking was found for both materials (faces: `r apa_print(ec2pf)$full_result$US_Valence`, toys: `r apa_print(ec2pg)$full_result$US_Valence`), the reduction by unpleasant USs was limited to toy figures, `r apa_print(ec2ng)$full_result$US_Valence`, and absent from faces `r apa_print(ec2nf)$full_result$US_Valence`.
Interestingly, the US valence effect was not modified by CS valence, `r ec2_$statistic$CS_Valence_US_Valence`: 
In contrast to the widespread notion that EC works best for neutral CSs, the EC effect was of the same magnitude for valent and neutral CSs.
^[It could be argued that unfamiliar toy figures are more neutral than human faces, and so the larger EC effect for the toys could be taken to support that notion, albeit applied to classes of materials varied between participants, not variations between CSs within participants.]
<!-- As another unexpected finding, the EC effect for faces was restricted to positive USs; there was no difference in evaluations between face CSs paired with negative USs and those not paired at all (this was not the case for the toy figures). -->

### Validation of the Two-button-sets procedure

The responses in the TBS task are given descriptively and in a condensed form in Table \@ref(tab:freqtable2), which is structured as in Exp. 1 for ease of reference by pairing status and valence (positive vs. negative; neutral foils are not shown, and data are collapsed across all other factors).

We first investigated effects of the manipulated variables on the proportion of Memory-set responses.
We expected (and found) the memory manipulation to be reflected in a higher proportion of Memory-set responses for paired target CSs as compared to non-paired foil stimuli:
The majority of paired CSs (60%) were judged 'remembered' (i.e., received Memory-set responses); only a minority (15%) of nonpaired foils was also falsely 'remembered' as having been paired with a US.
^[In addition to confirming the effect of the memory manipulation, 
a logistic regression analysis (which included random intercepts as well as random slopes for US and CS Valence) of the choice of Response Set (Memory vs. Attitude), with CS Valence, US Valence, and Material as predictors, indicated effects of all three experimental factors.
We conducted separate analyses of paired CSs and nonpaired foils to simplify interpretation of these findings.
For paired CSs, effects of Material and CS Valence were found, as well as interactions of Material with both valence factors.
Valent CSs were more often judged 'remembered' than neutral CSs, `r apa_print(x2.p)$full_result$CS_Valence_Q`.
Faces were more often judged 'remembered' than toy figures, `r apa_print(x2.p)$full_result$Material1`. 
An additional Material x CS Valence interaction indicated that the 'Memory-set' advantage was observed for negative faces but positive toy figures, `r apa_print(x2.p)$full_result$Material1_CS_Valence_L`. 
Also, toy figures paired with negative (vs. positive) USs received 'Memory-set' responses somewhat more often, `r apa_print(x2.p)$full_result$Material1_US_Valence_L`. 
Neither Material (`r apa_print(x2.u)$full_result$Material1`) nor CS Valence (linear: `r apa_print(x2.u)$full_result$CS_Valence_L`, quadratic: `r apa_print(x2.u)$full_result$CS_Valence_Q`) affected judgments of nonpaired foils (and the US Valence factor has only a single level for these items).]



Next, we analyzed frequencies of "pleasant"/"unpleasant" responses for paired CSs as well as nonpaired foils. 
Overall, these judgments were affected by main effects of US Valence (`r apa_print(x2)$full_result$US_Valence_L`) and CS Valence (`r apa_print(x2)$full_result$CS_Valence_L`).
Importantly, the US Valence effect was again modulated by Response Set (i.e., it differed between Memory and Attitude-set responses, `r apa_print(x2)$full_result$US_Valence_L_pdset`). 
In addition, Response Set also interacted with CS Valence, with smaller CS Valence effects on Memory than Attitude judgments, `r apa_print(x2)$full_result$CS_Valence_L_pdset1`. 
^[Additional effects included a main effect of Response Set, `r apa_print(x2)$full_result$pdset`, a Response Set by Material interaction, `r apa_print(x2)$full_result$Material1_pdset1`.as well as three-way interactions of Response Set with CS Valence and Material,  `r apa_print(x2)$full_result$Material1_CS_Valence_Q_pdset1`, and with CS Valence and US Valence,  `r apa_print(x2)$full_result$US_Valence_L_CS_Valence_L_pdset1`.]
To break down these findings, we report separate analyses by item type (CSs vs. foils) and Response Set (Memory vs. Attitude), which jointly define the four quadrants of Table 2.

We focused first on paired CSs, for which "pleasant"/"unpleasant" responses CSs showed the same pattern of effects as obtained in the overall analyses reported above.
Most importantly, the interaction of US Valence with Response Set (Memory vs. Attitude) was robustly significant, `r apa_print(x2p)$full_result$US_Valence_L_pdset`, suggesting that US Valence effect on judgments differed between Memory-set and Attitude-set responses.
For paired stimuli, Memory-set judgments (top left quadrant) quite accurately reflected actual US valence (albeit with a somewhat a lower accuracy than in Experiment 1):
When participants experienced remembering US valence for a paired stimulus, they were accurate in 70% of cases.
The strongest effect on Memory-set judgments was exerted by US Valence, `r  apa_print(x2pM)$full_result$US_Valence_L` (i.e., "pleasant" responses were more likely for CSs paired with pleasant USs). 
Additional (smaller) effects were obtained for CS Valence, `r  apa_print(x2pM)$full_result$CS_Valence_L` (with pleasant CSs more likely judged "pleasant", reflecting attitude-consistent guessing), and Material, `r  apa_print(x2pM)$full_result$Material` (with face CSs less likely to be judged "pleasant", perhaps reflecting the finding that pleasant face CSs were less likely classified using the 'Memory-set' responses).
^[In addition, the above three-way interaction between Response Set, Material, and CS Valence was reflected here as a significant Material by CS Valence interaction, `r apa_print(x2pM)$full_result$Material1_CS_Valence_Q`.]

### Is EC observed without feelings of remembering US valence?

Next, Attitude-set judgments for paired CSs were analyzed, with a particular focus on whether or not they are influenced by US valence in a similar manner as were Memory-set judgments.
However, as reflected in the bottom-left quadrant of Table 2, those CSs were not evaluated in accordance with US valence.
In a logistic regression, only a CS Valence effect on these judgments was found, `r  apa_print(x2pA)$full_result$CS_Valence_L` (with initially pleasant CSs more likely judged pleasant). 
Importantly, replicating the absence of an EC effect in the absence of feelings of remembering US valence, US Valence did not affect these judgments, `r  apa_print(x2pA)$full_result$US_Valence_L`.

As in Experiment 1, we additionally computed a *BF* on the proportions of responses in line with US Valence for paired neutral CSs that received an Attitude-set judgment.
Going beyond failing to find an EC effect for Attitude-set responses, the Bayesian analysis yielded evidence against above-chance responses in line with US valence (*M =* `r mean(prop_correct_tbs_att$prop[prop_correct_tbs_att$correct_response=="correct"])`; *SD =* `r sd(prop_correct_tbs_att$prop[prop_correct_tbs_att$correct_response=="correct"])`).
This supports the absence of (even small) EC effects in the absence of experiences of remembering, `r printBFRR(bf_prop_tbs_att)`. 

### Is there evidence for an affect-as-information bias?

Pleasantness judgments of nonpaired foils (i.e., stimuli not presented together with USs) varied only as a function of pre-experimental valence, `r  apa_print(x2u)$full_result$CS_Valence_L`, and this effect was not modulated by Response set, `r  apa_print(x2u)$full_result$CS_Valence_L_pdset1`.
For those (relatively few) foils for which participants falsely 'remembered' that a US had been paired with them (i.e., used the Memory response set; top right quadrant), they reported a US valence on the novel task that tended to be consistent with pre-experimental attitudes: 
A stimulus falsely judged as having been paired with a US was evaluated in accordance with pre-existing attitudes in 72% of cases. 
However, note that in a logistic regression of this relatively small subset of responses, the effect of pre-existing valence (while descriptively consistent with the overall analysis) was not significant, `r  apa_print(x2uM)$full_result$CS_Valence_L`.

Focusing on the bottom right quadrant (i.e., Attitude-set judgments for nonpaired stimuli), it is apparent that judgments reflected pre-experimental attitudes, `r  apa_print(x2uA)$full_result$CS_Valence_L`:
Participants consistently reported the attitude corresponding to their pre-study ratings in 84% of cases.
Besides this strong effect of CS Valence, the logistic regression analysis did not yield other significant effects.

In sum, responses on the TBS task again appropriately reflected the memory and attitude manipulations.
We replicated the absence of EC effects when participants reported they had no feeling of remembering the valence of the US that were paired with a given CS (i.e., the effect of US Valence was limited to Memory-set responses).
We also replicated the attitude-as-information bias (i.e., the effect of CS Valence on Memory-set responses), which was now obtained not only for nonpaired foils but also for paired CSs.
