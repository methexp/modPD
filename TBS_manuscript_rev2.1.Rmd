abstract: |
  Attitude research has capitalized on evaluative conditioning procedures to gain insight into how evaluations are formed and may be changed. In evaluative conditioning, a conditioned stimulus (CS; e.g., an unfamiliar soda brand) is paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US) of affective value (e.g., a pleasant picture). Following this pairing, a change in CS liking may be observed (e.g., the soda brand is liked better). A question with far-reaching theoretical and practical implications is whether the change in CS liking is found when participants feel they do not remember the CS-US pairings at the time an evaluation is produced about the CS. Here, we introduce a new conditional judgment procedure - the two-button-sets (TBS) task - for probing evaluative conditioning effects without feelings of remembering about the valence of the US paired with the CS. In three experiments, the TBS is (1) is successfully validated; it is also used to (2) provide preliminary information on the feeling of remembering question, and (3) to examine an affect-consistent bias in memory judgments for CS-US pairings. Results do not support evaluative effects in the absence of feelings of remembering, and they oppose the view that affect-consistent bias is limited to memory uncertainty. We discuss these finding in light of previous evidence and of dual-learning models of attitudes. We also discuss limitations and research avenues related to the new procedure.

Over the past two decades, a wealth of evaluative conditioning studies have advanced our understanding of how evaluations may be formed and changed. 
In evaluative conditioning studies, a change in the evaluation of a conditioned stimulus (CS) may be observed following its pairing with an affective stimulus (US). 
In this literature, researchers have long been interested in  whether evaluative conditioning (EC) effects are found in the absence of awareness of the CS-US pairings. 
To address this question, *experimental studies* have suppressed the encoding of the CS-US pairs at the learning stage, and examined what remained of the EC effect under such testing conditions. 
In general, these studies found no support for the unconscious EC hypothesis.
For instance, when stimulus strength is low or when a secondary task prevents the successful encoding of the CS-US pairings, an evaluative conditioning effect is unlikely to be elicited [for a recent review, see @corneille_associative_2019]. 
In contrast, *correlational studies* have classically used memory measures as a proxy for the (successful or unsuccessful) encoding of the CS-US pairs. 
This second line of research brought mixed support to the possibility of EC without CS-US pairing awareness (see below). In the last decade, however, it became increasingly apparent that that this second strand of – correlational – research examined relations between memory and evaluations, rather than the role of encoding performance in attitude acquisition [for instance, see @gawronski_what_2012]. 
As a result, evaluative conditioning research became increasingly interested in linking the question of evaluative formation and change to memory models [e.g., @gast_declarative_2018; @stahl_evaluative_2018].  
Furthermore, there are reasons to believe (as we will argue below) that this research has examined EC in the absence of subjective feelings of remembering rather than memory performance [see also @waroquier_distinguishing_2020]. 
The question of whether EC can be found without participants’ feeling of remembering US valence is important for both theoretical research (e.g., for models of the role of memory processes in EC; for theories of implicit learning and consciousness) and applied research (e.g., on the controllability of the effects of persuasive influences on attitudes and behaviors).

Below, we first provide an overview and discussion of how recent research has addressed EC effects as a function of memory performance, and what conclusions were derived from two main procedures: the per-item and process dissociation procedures. 
In a second step, we introduce a novel procedure that combines the advantages of the two prior ones. 
In the empirical section, we validate the new procedure and use it to provide firmer conclusions about the contingency of EC effects upon feelings of remembering US valence. 
In doing so, we also shed additional light on affect-as-information processes. 
In the general discussion, we summarize the main insights of the new procedure introduced here, and we explain how it can be used in future research (i.e., attitude research and beyond).

## A short overview of research on the memory question

Recent research developed and relied on two categories of procedures to examine associations between EC effects and memory.
A first line of research relied on per-item procedures. 
A second line of research made use of a process dissociation procedure.

The per-item rationale consisted of examining if evaluative conditioning effects are found for CSs that participants prove unable to pair with the identity or the valence of their associated US in a separate memory task. 
As also true for any awareness measure, assessments of CS-US pairing memory are most informative and relevant if they meet certain criteria [@shanks_characteristics_1994].
Among those criteria is the information criterion: the requirement that assessments tap memory for those bits of information that are critical in producing the effect in question. 
The information criterion is ideally met (1) by assessments made at the level of the specific CS item (as opposed to aggregating across items and classifying participants as aware or unaware), and (2) by assessing memory for US valence (rather than US identity). 
When relying on per-item procedures, researchers generally found no EC effect for CSs associated with incorrect memory reports in a separate memory task [@pleyers_aware_2007; @stahl_respective_2009]. 
In addition, memory for US valence rather than memory for US identity proved to be critical for obtaining evaluative conditioning effects [@stahl_respective_2009]. 
While per-item procedures meet the information criterion, they however fail to meet the immediacy criterion: the requirement that awareness should be assessed at the time when the relevant cognitive process occurs (i.e., the one participants' awareness is about), not later [@mitchell_propositional_2009].
In per-item procedures, evaluations of all stimuli are typically elicited in a rating task, whereas memory is assessed in a different, independent task.
Thus, in per-item procedures, the memory assessment is temporally separated from CS evaluations. 

In contrast to per-item procedures, the Process Dissociation procedure for studying EC in the absence of memory [@hutter_dissociating_2012] aimed at separating, at the aggregate level and within a single task, participants’ memory for US valence from their attitude towards the CS in the absence of such explicit memory.
In the Process Dissociation procedure, participants indicate for each CS whether the CS was paired with pleasant or unpleasant USs (by selecting either a “pleasant” or “unpleasant” response). 
Alternatively, if participants cannot remember the valence of the US, they have to indicate whether they find the CS pleasant or unpleasant (using the same set of “pleasant” or “unpleasant” responses). 
Participants thus perform a two-stage decision within a single task: 
First, they decide whether they remember US valence or not. 
The outcome of this decision determines how to proceed in the second stage—report the memory judgment from the first stage (if they remember US valence) or perform and report an attitude judgment (if they don’t remember US valence). 
Using multinomial processing modelling, these procedures found a small but significantly above-zero estimate for a parameter that was interpreted as indicative of US-consistent evaluations without conscious CS-US pairing memory. 
As classically achieved in Process Dissociation procedures [@jacoby_process_1991; for review see @yonelinas_process-dissociation_2012], this was done by comparing response frequencies in conditions where attitudes towards the CSs and memory for their paired US valence operated synergistically (inclusion condition) versus antagonistically (exclusion condition).
	
Both per-item and process dissociation procedures have delivered valuable insights in evaluative learning research. 
These procedures, however, come with some limitations.
One important limitation applying to per-item procedures is that they involve two separate measurements of CS evaluations and US memory. 
These multiple assessments imply additional measurement error. 
This is less of a problem in the process dissociation procedure as it involves a unique measurement for each CS. 
However, contrary to per-item procedures, data collected in process dissociation procedures are interpretable only at the group aggregate level (i.e., parameter estimates computed across inclusion and exclusion groups, based on data aggregated across items and persons). 
Thus, these procedures do not conform to the information criterion, as they fail to deliver information about memory judgments or evaluations by a specific person about a specific CS. 
This restriction furthermore prevents addressing additional research questions by relating memory states to evaluations at the item level (see also the General Discussion). 
	
Here, we introduce a new procedure that makes the best of the two previous approaches while overcoming some of their limitations. 
Before doing so, however, it is important to discuss how these and complementary approaches have dealt with a decision heuristic that may contaminate memory assessments: the affect-as-information heuristic.
	
	
## The affect-as-information bias and how it has been dealt with

When participants lack memory about the valence of the USs paired with a CS, but are nevertheless asked to report it, they may respond on the basis of their feelings toward the CS (e.g., “the CS feels pleasant, so it must have been paired with positive USs”). 
This response pattern may then be mistakenly interpreted as indicating that an EC effect was accompanied by US valence memory. 
As a result, researchers are at risk of rejecting from the “US-unaware” category those CSs for which no conscious US valence memory existed but for which “false US valence memory” was rather inferred from CS evaluation. 
Hence, affect-as-information can make per-item analyses too conservative a test for the possibility of evaluative conditioning effects in the absence of US valence memory.

As a side comment, the affect-as-information heuristic may explain reversed evaluative conditioning effects sometimes found for CSs associated with incorrect valence-memory responses (i.e., evaluative shifts and memory judgments inconsistent with actual US valence). 
The effect is assumed to be based on pre-experimental CS attitudes that are opposite to the valence of the US. 
If US valence memory is absent for those CSs, then participants may use their pre-existing attitude to inform both their US memory judgment—leading to an incorrect valence-memory response—and their CS evaluations—leading to an evaluative effect opposite to the US’s valence (i.e., a reversed EC effect). 
Such reversed EC effects for CS with incorrect memory responses were found in Stahl et al. (2009, Experiment 3; meta-analysis of Experiments 2–4).
	
Because of this contamination issue, studies have attempted to minimize, control, or assess the role of affect-as-information in the measurement of US valence memory. 
In studies relying on the per-item procedure, the contribution of affect-as-information was dealt with by introducing an “I don’t remember” response option in the memory task, thereby allowing participants to indicate their lack of memory (instead of forcing them to guess). 
In doing so, researchers avoided pressuring participants into reporting a CS-US pairing memory they did not feel confident about. 
In Process Dissociation studies, the issue is similarly avoided as participants are not forced to guess the US valence: if participants think they do not remember the US valence, they are instructed to report their attitude, not their memory response.

The above discussion highlights that, to avoid forcing participants to guess, both procedures have asked participants to report their memory of US valence only if they felt they could retrieve it. 
Hence, both per-item and process dissociation methods eventually captured participants’ subjective feelings of remembering (or not) the US valence. 
This is an important qualification, considering that both procedures initially considered memory measures as proxies for the successful encoding of the CS-US pairs at the learning stage (rather than as indexes of feelings of remembering the US valence at the judgment stage). 
This interpretational updating is perhaps best illustrated in a recent study by Hütter and De Houwer (2017) showing that estimates of the memory parameter are affected by criterion manipulations. 
As these authors acknowledged: 
“MPT estimates could depend on the subjective criteria that participants use to decide whether they remember or do not remember the CS-US pairings.” (p. 51).

To sum up, recent developments in EC research acknowledge that memory studies (1) ultimately dealt with associations between memory and EC effects (rather than with the role of encoding performance in attitude acquisition), and (2) likely captured (although unintendingly) subjective feelings of remembering in addition to objective memory accuracy. 
In other words, these methods have informed us about EC effects (not in the absence of memory but) in the absence of feelings of remembering. 
The method introduced in the remaining of this introduction aims at further improving the assessment of EC effects in the absence of feelings of remembering.


## Introducing the two-button-sets (TBS) task

(ref:task-displays) Screen displays of the per-item valence-memory task (left), the process-dissociation task (center, inclusion condition), and the TBS task (right).

```{r task-displays, fig.cap="(ref:task-displays)", fig.env = "figure*", fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path="./fig/modPD_task_displays.png")
```

We introduce here a new conditional judgment procedure: the two-button-sets (or TBS) task for estimating EC effects in the absence of feelings of remembering the US valence paired with the CS. 
The TBS display is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:task-displays) (right). 
For reference, the Figure also illustrates the per-item and process dissociation task displays (left and center). 
Contrary to Hütter et al. (2012)'s process dissociation procedure, the TBS introduces two sets of “pleasant”/“unpleasant” response buttons.
The first set is designated for memory judgments. 
The second set is designated for attitude judgments. 
On a given trial, only one judgment is reported, conditional upon the feeling of remembering:
Whenever participants felt that they remember US valence, they are instructed to use the Memory responses set (in the upper half of the screen) to report the outcome of their memory judgment. 
Alternatively, if they felt that they do not remember, participants are instructed to use the Attitude responses set (in the lower half of the screen) to report the outcome of their attitude judgment. 


The distinctive feature of the TBS is that it renders metacognitive decisions (i.e., whether participants feel they remember the US valence) observable at the item-within-person level (see Figure \@ref(fig:pd-procedure-diagram)). 
This has three important advantages. 
First, because the remember decision is unveiled, it is no longer necessary to infer it indirectly from parameter estimates of a multinomial processing tree model, as is the case in the process dissociation approach. 
In turn, the between-subject instruction manipulation can be omitted so that a single group of participants is sufficient. 
This makes the new procedure more efficient and flexible. 
For example, it can be used in within-participant designs that allow for more stringent experimental control as well as higher statistical power. 
Second, contrary to the per-item task but similar to the original process dissociation procedure, the immediacy criterion is met and the error measurement issue originating from multiple assessments of evaluation and memory is reduced. 
This is because a single measurement (either for US memory or for CS evaluation) is involved for each individual CS.
^[Both of the TBS's questions must be answered by a single response on a single trial, thereby eliminating the temporal distance between retrieval operations. However, the two questions may or may not involve only a single unitary memory retrieval operation. In a modeling framework such as MINERVA, it is plausible that a single operation would be sufficient, with the strength of the memory echo informing the Memory-Attitude decision, and the echo's content informing the pleasant-unpleasant response [for an application to EC, see @aust_memory-based_2019; @stahl_evaluative_2018]. Yet, participants may also approach the task differently, using a two-step approach involving multiple retrieval operations. Future empirical and modeling research is needed to address this question.]
Third, the CS-level information enables finer-grained analyses and more rigorous tests; most importantly, EC effects can be analyzed at the item-within-person instead of the group level; hence, the TBS respects the information criterion. 


(ref:pd-procedure-diagram) Schematic comparison of the two-stage tasks in the process-dissociation (**A**) and TBS tasks (**B**). In both the process-dissociation and TBS tasks, participants first introspect whether they remember US valence or not. If they do remember US valence, they report their US-valence memory judgment; if they do not remember US valence, they report an attitude judgment. While the decision to report either a memory or attitude judgment remains unobserved in the process-dissociation task (A), it is observed as the choice between Memory and Attitude button sets in the TBS task (B). Panels with dashed lines represent unobservable latent states; those with solid lines observed task components. Bold rectangles represent observable response options at each task stage. Black and white arrows represent paths for positively and negatively paired CSs, respectively; grey arrows represent common paths.

```


To sum up, the TBS combines the advantages and reduces the limitations of the previous per-item and process-dissociation procedures by introducing slight but significant departures from these two procedures. 
The TBS is highly similar to the per-item task: 
It can be seen as expanding the "I don’t remember" response into a binary CS evaluation. 
The TBS is even more similar to the original process dissociation task: 
Here, participants' two-stage task remains the same, except that the TBS is augmented by a second set of “pleasant”/“unpleasant” buttons so that a dedicated set of buttons is used for both the presence and the absence of feelings of remembering. 
This adaptation of the original process dissociation task allows analyses at the item-within-person levels: 
Beyond procedural simplification (i.e., removing the need for a between-subjects manipulation of instruction), the TBS also simplifies data-analytical assumptions (i.e., it is no longer necessary to assume identical processes in the inclusion and exclusion conditions, nor independency across participants). 
Instead of using a MPT model as that proposed by Hütter et al. (2012) to produce what are hoped to be process-pure estimates of the cognitive processes of interest (in particular, EC in the absence of memory) at the group level, the TBS obtains per-item responses that are not claimed to be process pure but can be easily analyzed together with the results of other measures to investigate and scrutinize their validity.
The TBS simplifies the original process dissociation procedure and provides important insights into metacognitive processes involved in participants’ decisions at the item level (i.e., feelings of remembering the valence of the US paired with a given CS).

These assets are helpful for examining the role of feelings of remembering in EC and the affect-as-information question (see also below).
As we will discuss in the general discussion, they are also helpful for addressing complementary questions. 
Observable decisions at the item level also allows assessing the accuracy of participants’ feelings of remembering (e.g., the proportion of “remember” reports reflecting accurate US memory, and the proportion of “I don’t remember” cases in which correct US memory is nevertheless present). 
TBS data can be fruitfully related to the outcomes of other measures obtained from the same participant, for instance, evaluative (e.g., ratings) or (metacognitive) memory measures (e.g., Remember-Know-Guess or confidence judgments). 
Relating response-level responses to other measures allows investigating a wider range of research questions regarding memory-evaluation relations.

We now turn to the empirical section, where we validate the TBS and use it to address our current feelings-of-remembering and affect-as-information questions.


# Overview of present studies

To empirically support the new TBS task in a manner comparable to that of the established tasks, we ran two validation studies.
The studies varied whether a CS was paired with a US or not, hence manipulating US memory. 
They also varied whether a CS was neutral or valenced, thereby manipulating CS attitudes. 
<!-- We assessed whether the memory manipulations were adequately reflected in the proportion of 'remember' responses, and whether the attitude manipulations were adequately reflected in CS evaluations in the absence of memory. -->
<!-- In addition, we used the TBS procedure to explore regularities of the relation between mnemonic and evaluative judgments, namely the attitude-as-information bias. -->
In addition to this validation part, we used the TBS task to provide preliminary information on whether EC can be observed in the absence of feelings of remembering US Valence.

We also investigated whether attitudes contaminate memory measures (i.e., affect-as-information bias) in ways beyond those discussed above. 
Bar-Anan and colleagues [@bar-anan_effect_2014; @bar-anan_evaluative_2010] manipulated attitudes experimentally before assessing how they affected US valence memories. 
Participants’ memory reports were biased toward their evaluation of the CS, which is consistent with the use of an affect-as-information heuristic. 
However, the bias was found to be absent from guessing and vague-memory cases; contrary to the authors’ expectations, it was restricted to cases where participants claimed to have clear memory of a pairing. 
The authors concluded that “evaluation influenced memory judgement in a way that participants experienced as clear memory, although it was only a reconstructed memory judgment based on evaluative information rather than true memory traces of past events.” (p.1042). 
These findings importantly suggest that participants may rely on affect-as-information decision making, but not necessarily to overcome vague memories. 
In other words, they suggest that attitudes may bias memory measures even—or especially—when participants are confident of their memories and experience them as clear recollections. 
Yet, the findings reported by Bar-Anan and colleagues were based on old/new recognition judgments of specific CS-US pairs instead of valence-memory judgments, and so it is unclear how they affect valence-memory measures. 
Using the new procedure proposed above, we will be able to provide answers to this complementary question.

An additional goal of the present line of research was to compare the TBS with the process-dissociation procedures with a focus on testing the process-dissociation approach's underlying assumptions.
To mirror the process-dissociation procedure, in addition to the standard TBS instruction condition we also ran a group that worked on a TBS variant of the Exclusion instruction, and we collected additional memory measures at the end of the study.
<!-- The exclusion condition is not required by the modified PD procedure but was originally included to allow for testing the invariance assumption of the PD approach. -->
For the sake of conciseness and because these complementary analyses were not directly relevant to our present validation goal, the present article does however not address this issue, and the data from that condition were not included in the analyses reported below.
Hence we omitted the TBS Exclusion condition and these additional memory measures from the empirical section (the data from these conditions and measures will be reported elsewhere and made available in the OSF repository).

To sum up, the present study is primarily aimed at introducing the TBS and gathering empirical support for its validity for investigating how remembering US valence relates to EC effects. 
In doing so, this research provides preliminary information about whether EC is found without feelings of remembering US valence, and information relevant to the attitude-as-information bias. 
These latter – more theoretical - goals, however, should be considered more secondary in the context of the present study.

<!-- In sum, the present study aims at (1) gathering empirical support for the validity of the TBS procedure, and (2) further exploring the attitude-as-information bias. -->

<!-- Towards these goals, we conducted two experiments that manipulated both memory and attitudes to show that these manipulations are adequately reflected in the metacognitive memory and attitude measures provided by the TBS task, and to probe for attitude-consistent memory judgments. -->

<!-- As a third goal, we aimed at informing strategies for controlling persuasive influences. -->
<!-- In applied contexts, strategies for controlling persuasive influences must rely on memory or metamemory judgments (such as those assessed in the present tasks) because these are typically the only pieces of information available in everyday situations. -->
<!-- It is therefore important to study the validity of these judgments in persuasion contexts in order to evaluate their usefulness in different types of control strategies. -->
<!-- Experiment 2 additionally collected additional memory measures that allowed us to explore the usefulness of metamemory judgments for informing control strategies.  -->


# Experiment 1

Experiment 1 probes the validity of the TBS task by manipulating both CS-US pairing memory and CS attitudes (within subjects) to test whether the manipulations selectively affect the Memory-set and Attitude-set responses.
CS stimuli were selected individually on the basis of a given participant's pre-study ratings.
To manipulate pairing memory, only the neutrally pre-rated CSs (but not the valent foils) were paired with USs during learning.
This should affect the frequency of Memory-set responses for the neutral CSs (compared to the valent foils).
To manipulate CS attitudes, the most valent (positive and negative) foil stimuli were compared (that were not paired with USs during learning):
For these stimuli, Attitude-set responses should reflect pre-rated attitudes.
Figure \@ref(fig:procedure) gives an overview of the experimental procedure.

(ref:procedure-caption) Illustration of general procedure. CS items were pre-rated and then assigned to within-subject conditions. After the learning phase, the TBS task was administered, followed by post-learning ratings. Exp.3 deviated from this procedure in that one of three valence-memory tasks (TBS, VMA, or 3ACE) was administered, and the order of valence-memory task and post-study evaluative ratings was counterbalanced.
<!-- and memory measures (US valence and US identity). In Exp.1, US valence memory was assessed using the per-item task (Stahl et al., 2009); in Exp.2, US valence memory was assessed using confidence ratings followed by remember/know/guess judgments. -->
<!-- Exp. 1 had a 2 x 2 (repeated measures) design: Valence (positive vs. negative) x Pairing (critical/paired vs. control/unpaired). The 24 most neutrally pre-rated face stimuli (for a given participant) were selected as neutral CSs (12 were paired with positive USs, and 12 with negative USs); the 16 most extremely rated ones (8 positive, 8 negative) were used as valenced control CSs. US valence memory was assessed using the per-item task (Stahl et al., 2009). -->
<!-- Experiment 2 had a 2 (TBS task: present vs. absent) x 2 (material: faces vs. figures) x 2 (US: positive, non-paired, negative) x 3 (CS valence: positive, neutral, negative) design (the last 2 factors were within-subjects). The 24 most neutral and the 18 most valent stimuli (9 positive, 9 negative) were selected (42 in total; CSs: 16 neutral, 6 positive, 6 negative; non-paired foils: 8 neutral, 3 positive, 3 negative). Of the CSs, half of each subset were paired with USs of each valence. A given CS was paired twice with each of 4 different USs of the same valence. US valence memory was assessed using confidence ratings followed by remember/know/guess judgments. -->

## Method

For the present studies, we report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations (except the inclusion/exclusion factor, as explained above), and all measures in the study (except the memory measures that were collected after the TBS and post-rating blocks, as explained above).
The study was registered prior to data collection and analysis (see osf.io/rkb3w; deviating from the preregistration, the present article does not report the analyses involving the inclusion/exclusion factor).
Materials, data, and analysis scripts are available at osf.io/ygcz4.


### Participants and Design

The study realizes a 2 x 2 design with repeated measures: Valence (positive vs. negative) x Pairing (critical/paired vs. control/unpaired).
We collected a sample of $N$=60 participants (students at the Université catholique du Louvain), as this is approximately 2x the sample size recruited by @hutter_dissociating_2012 (as recommended by the rule of thumb for replications by @simonsohn_small_2015).
We had to exclude the data from 1 participant who was accidentally run in both the inclusion and exclusion condition, and from 17 participants due to errors on instruction checks; the remaining sample consisted of $N$=42 participants.

### Materials and Procedure

We used the same materials as @hutter_dissociating_2012: A set of photographic images of faces served as CSs; a set of IAPS images served as USs.
The face CSs were pre-rated by participants by positioning a cursor on a slider ranging from 'very unpleasant' (-100) to 'very pleasant' (+100).
Of these faces, the 24 most neutrally pre-rated ones served as critical CSs (i.e., 12 paired with positive USs, 12 with negative USs).
The 16 most extremely pre-rated faces (8 of each valence) were not presented during the learning phase but served as valent control stimuli.
During learning, the 24 critical CSs were repeatedly paired with USs (i.e., each CS was presented once with one of 8 USs of the same valence).
Dependent measures were collected for all 40 CS stimuli (i.e., the two sets of 24 critical/paired and 16 control/nonpaired face photographs).

The procedure closely followed that of the @hutter_dissociating_2012 studies.
First, participants pre-rated all 120 face stimuli.
In the subsequent learning phase, CS and US images were presented side by side on the computer screen (positions were randomly selected for each trial).
After learning, memory and attitude were assessed for all 40 CSs.
The TBS task was implemented first.
After instructions were given, instruction understanding was tested: 
Participants were presented with descriptions of the possible combinations of memory and attitude states (one for each possible case), and were asked to select the corresponding response according to instructions.
TBS was followed by post-learning evaluative ratings.
<!-- Finally, memory for US valence and US identity were assessed:  -->
<!-- Participants were asked to indicate (successively for each CS) whether it had previously been paired with pleasant or unpleasant USs; they could also report that they "don't know" the correct response. -->
<!-- When assessing participants' US identity memory, we presented them with a set of 16 US images for a given CS, and asked them to select any one of the eight that had been paired with that CS during learning. -->

### Data analysis

As a manipulation check, the pre-post change in CS evaluations was computed (i.e., post-learning evaluation minus pre-learning evaluation) and submitted to a repeated-measures ANOVA to probe for US valence effects.
The TBS responses (i.e., choice of Memory vs. Attitude response-button sets; pleasant vs. unpleasant response) were analyzed using logistic regression analyses, with by-person random intercepts and slopes for the experimental factors.
In Experiment 1, random effects for interactions were also added; this was not possible in Experiment 2 because of the more complex design, which yielded a more complex model that was not supported given the relatively limited data. 
Omitting the interaction terms from the random-effects structure of the model did not reduce the model's goodness of fit, $\chi^2(30)=9.69, p=.99$.

## Discussion

Results of Experiment 1 largely confirmed expectations:
First, the pairing manipulation was effective: a standard EC effect was found (along with a regression-to-the-mean effect for pre-experimentally valent stimuli), and the TBS task was successfully validated:
The choice of Memory-set versus Attitude response-button set reflected participants' metacognitive *remember* judgments (i.e., robustly higher rates of memory Memory-set responses for paired than non-paired stimuli); and Attitude-set responses reflected pre-learning evaluative ratings.

Second, we extended previous findings on memory-evaluation relations:
In line with Stahl et al. (2009), we found no EC when participans felt that they did not remember US valence.
In line with Bar-Anan et al. (2010, 2014), we found memory judgments for nonpaired stimuli to be biased by attitudes: 
Participants' valence-memory responses tended to be consistent with their pre-experimental ratings towards these stimuli.
This bias was obtained despite metacognitive 'remember' judgments, suggesting that participants were at least somewhat confident about their memories.

Note that Experiment 1 had several limitations.
Perhaps most importantly, as in previous studies, pairing memory and (pre-existing) attitude were confounded: 
Only neutrally pre-rated CSs were paired with (positive or negative) USs; valent CSs were never paired.
This means that we could not assess the simultaneous effects of pairing and pre-experimental attitudes on the same set of CSs.
<!-- ^[Each specific CS-US pairing was presented only once, while each stimulus (CS or US) was also paired with other stimuli (i.e., each CS was paired with 8 different USs; each US was paired, on average, with 2 different CSs).] -->
Experiment 2 addressed these limitations.

# Experiment 2

Experiment 2 examined the robustness of the findings from Experiment 1 and extended it in several ways: 
First, memory and attitudes were manipulated in a fully orthogonal within-subjects design by independently varying CS valence (positive, neutral, negative) and US valence (positive, non-paired, negative).
Second, new US material was used, and CS Material (human faces vs. toy figures) was additionally varied between subjects (this was done for generalization purposes; we did not expect any effects).
To control for carry-over effects on these measures from the TBS task, another group of participants was added that worked only on the latter two memory measures.
^[As in Experiment 1, we collected data for an additional TBS Exclusion condition and administered additional memory measures at the end of the study; this information is omitted from the Results section; and the data will be reported elsewhere and made available in the OSF repository.]

<!-- (ref:modPD2-caption) Experiment 2 had a 2 (TBS task: present vs. absent) x 2 (material: faces vs. figures) x 2 (US: positive, non-paired, negative) x 3 (CS valence: positive, neutral, negative) design (the last 2 factors were within-subjects). Pre-ratings of CS pleasantness were followed by the learning phase, in which participants viewed CS-US pairs. After learning, the TBS task was implemented for the TBS-present group; the TBS-absent group skipped this task. Post-study evaluative ratings were finally collected. -->

## Method

The study was preregistered at osf.io/mxtwd (here we focus on validating the TBS task; the analyses addressing the other goals will be reported elsewhere).
Material, data, and analysis scripts are available at osf.io/ygcz4.

### Participants and Design

Participants were randomly assigned to a 2 (*TBS*: present vs. absent) x 2 (*Material*: human faces vs. toy figures) between-subject design.
The sample consisted of $N$=76 students from the University of Cologne ($n_{TBS-present}=36, n_{TBS-absent}=40$).
^[The study aimed for $N=120$ participants; after the final day of data collection a total of $N=123$ had participated.
As in @hutter_dissociating_2012, but deviating from Exp. 1, participants ($n=13$) were excluded who failed to correctly implement the instructions even after reading them for the third time.
The total sample consisted of $N=110$ participants (i.e., an additional n=34 completed a TBS-Exclusion condition not reported here).]
Within subjects, *US Valence* (positive, neutral/non-paired, negative) and *CS Valence* (positive, neutral, negative), were manipulated orthogonally.
 
### Material

As in Experiment 1, images of faces were used as CSs (deviating from Exp.1, we selected only the first 100 from the set of 120 images).
As additional CSs, we used 100 photographs of toy figures (*Gogo Crazy Bones*).
As USs, we used 112 color images from the OASIS database (@kurdi_introducing_2017; 56 positive and 56 negative, with comparable arousal ratings).
For a given participant, the most neutrally pre-rated 24 faces or toys as well as the 18 most valent faces or toys (9 positive, 9 negative) served as CSs.
Of the 24 neutral CSs, 16 were paired with USs (8 positive, 8 negative).
Of the initially valent CSs, 3 from each valence were paired with USs of each valence (i.e., 3 initially positive as well as 3 initially negative CSs were paired with positive USs; the other 3 from each valence set were paired with negative USs).
The remaining 8 neutral CSs, together with 3 positive and 3 negative CSs, comprised the set of 14 non-paired control stimuli.
A set of four different USs was randomly assigned to and uniquely paired with each CS; each US was paired twice with that CS.
Where possible, dependent measures were collected for all 42 CSs; US identity memory was not assessed for non-paired stimuli.

### Procedure

The procedure closely followed that of Experiment 1. 
Deviating from Experiment 1, evaluative ratings were collected on a 20-point (instead of 200-point) scale.
Further deviating from Experiment 1, but in line with Hütter et al. (2012), we presented participants with up to 3 rounds of instructions and instruction-check items; participants with errors on the last instruction-check round were excluded from analyses. 
^[Given that Exp. 2 was run in a different lab (at the University of Cologne) and implemented in a different programming environment (OpenSesame) than Exp. 1, there may be additional differences between procedures that are not listed here because they have escaped our attention.]

## Discussion

Confirming the manipulation's effectiveness, Experiment 2 again obtained a robust EC effect (along with a regression to the mean for pre-experimentally valent CSs).
In line with Experiment 1, results again confirmed that the TBS task adequately reflects memory and attitude manipulations (i.e., Memory-set responses separated paired from non-paired stimuli and selectively reflected US valence effects; Attitude-set responses reflected pre-learning evaluative ratings).

Similar to Experiment 1, Experiment 2 also found no EC effect when participants felt that they did not remember US valence: The TBS task's Attitude-set judgments were not affected by US Valence.
Experiment 2 also replicated the attitude-as-information bias in memory judgments for nonpaired stimuli: 
Participants were more likely to remember (un)pleasant USs being paired with pre-experimentally positive (negative) nonpaired stimuli. 
Going beyond Experiment 1, here we orthogonally manipulated US Valence and CS Valence and found an effect of attitudes-as-information (i.e., CS Valence) not only for nonpaired foils but also for paired CSs.

In other words, participants were able, to different degrees, to selectively use the two sources (CS and US) of valence in their judgments:
On the one hand, US valence had a selective influence only on Memory-set but not Attitude-set judgments.
On the other hand, the effects of CS valence (although less selective) were stronger on Attitude-set judgments (where they reflected valid responding in adherence with task instructions) than on Memory-set judgments (where they reflected an attitude-as-information bias). 

By presenting participants with valent as well as neutral items, and with paired as well as non-paired items, Experiment 2 was able to separate effects of pairing from those of (pre-existing) evaluations. 
The use of this relatively complex design was required by our validation effort.
However, it departed from simpler designs typically used in EC studies, which generally present only neutral CSs paired with either pleasant or unpleasant USs.
For this reason, one may argue (1) that our primary validation goal is successful, but (2) that TBS conclusions regarding memory-EC relations were affected by---or even originated from---this unusual level of procedural complexity. 
To examine this possibility, we ran a third experiment that made use of the simpler design typically used in EC studies.
 <!-- that the findings obtained in Experiment 2 may be a function of this complexity, and that different findings may obtain in the more simple design commonly used in EC studies. -->
<!-- To test whether the TBS finding of no EC-without-memory effect was somehow biased by the presence (versus absence) of valent and nonpaired items, we conducted another study with the simple design. -->


# Experiment 3

Experiment 3 examines whether EC is found when US valence is not remembered, (1) with higher statistical power, and (2) by using a simplified design (i.e., a design without nonpaired and valent stimuli, as typically done in EC studies). 
In doing so, this experiment provides what may be considered a more liberal (or even fairer) test for EC effects without remembering US valence. 
This was done in a first condition.
<!-- This study aims at replicating and strengthening the evidence --- that no EC is found when participants experience a lack of memory --- with higher statistical power, and in a simplified design (i.e., without nonpaired and valent stimuli) that is more comparable to previous studies. -->

In a second condition, we went beyond this first objective and replicated a study by @waroquier_distinguishing_2020 who reported EC effects when participants indicated that they did not have conscious knowledge about US valence.
In their study, after the learning phase, participants were presented with a CS and asked to report the valence of the associated US.
They were then asked to indicate the basis of their valence-memory response, that is, to attribute their response to one of several different mental states: *memory* (i.e., when they felt they remembered the pairing), *gut-feeling* (i.e., when they had an intuition or feeling of familiarity about the US's valence), or *random guessing*.
In their Experiment 1, Waroquier et al. found EC effects not only for *memory* but also for *gut-feeling* attributions; in their Experiment 2, EC was found for *memory* and *random-guessing*, but not for *gut-feeling* attributions.
These results contrast with the TBS finding of no EC in the absence of feelings of remembering US valence, suggesting that a more fine-grained distinction of different mental states (i.e., three rather than two), and/or a more sensitive measurement (i.e., continuous rating scale rather than binary choice) may be more suited for detecting EC without feelings of remembering.

To begin exploring possible reasons for such a discrepancy, we also included a third condition in which we adapted the TBS approach of conditionally assessing either memory or attitudes as a function of remembering US valence.
Specifically, we offered three (rather than two) attributions; and we replaced the binary attitude judgments by continuous evaluative rating scales (i.e., a three-attribution, continuous evaluation task, hereafter *3ACE*).
Participants' task was to assess their feelings of remembering US valence; if they remembered it, they were to report it by using binary pleasant/unpleasant buttons as in the TBS; if they had some gut feeling or intuition, they were asked to evaluate the CS on a rating scale; likewise, if they felt they were guessing randomly, they were asked to evaluate the CS on yet another rating scale.
With these modifications, the data acquisition rationale was similar to Waroquier et al. (2020), but with a higher degree of adherence to the immediacy criterion (i.e., the data were obtained from a single response at a single point in time, rather than separated across trials or even separate blocks).

In sum, we implemented a between-subjects manipulation of valence-memory task type with three levels: 
Participants completed either the TBS task, Waroquier et al.'s (2020) valence-memory attribution (i.e., VMA) task, or the 3ACE task.
We also counterbalanced the order of post-experimental evaluative ratings and the valence-memory task (which had no effect on the results).
^[Furthermore, to explore the relation between memory judgments on the different memory tasks, we also varied task type within-subjects:
Participants completed a second valence-memory task (i.e., participants in the TBS and 3ACE condition completed the VMA task, and participants in the VMA condition completed a TBS task).
Finally, to explore the accuracy of subjective memory attributions, participants completed a US identity memory task.
The results of these tasks are not reported in the present paper (as it primarily focuses on the validation of the TBS task); procedural details and results will be reported elsewhere (see osf.io/ygcz4).]

## Method

The study was preregistered at osf.io/pducs. 
Material, data, and analysis scripts are available at osf.io/ygcz4.

### Participants and Design

Participants were randomly assigned to a 3 (valence-memory task: TBS, VMA, 3ACE) x 2 (order: evaluative ratings first vs. valence-memory task first) between-subjects design.
They were recruited from the lab database (i.e., University of Cologne student population) and were invited to participate either in the lab or via internet.
As compensation, course credit or an amount of EUR 8 was offered.
We recruited participants week by week until there were at least 180 participants who had passed the instruction-understanding, seriousness, and attention checks (see also below); this resulted in a final sample size of 185 participants.
<!-- Of these 201 participants, 15 were excluded because they failed the seriousness or attention checks (i.e., they either indicated that their data should not be used for scientific purposes, or that they were not able to pay sustained attention during the learning phase); one additional participant with technical problems was excluded.  -->

### Material

We used the same face images as Waroquier et al., but replaced the IAPS images (which cannot be used in online studies for licence reasons) by comparable images from the OASIS database.
Participants pre-rated 60 images, and the 40 most neutral ones were used as CSs in all subsequent study phases.
Half of them were assigned to be paired with positive CSs, the other half with negative CSs; each CS was paired with a single US.
An additional set of 3 US images of the same valence were assigned to each CS to be used as foils in the test of US identity memory.

### Procedure

The procedure was similar to the previous studies (with procedural details closely following those from Waroquier et al., 2020).
After collecting pre-study ratings (on a scale from -200 to +200), the learning phase began, presenting 240 trials in which a CS and a US were shown simultaneously and side by side on the screen for 1500 ms (with a 100 ms ISI).
Participants were instructed to carefully watch all the stimuli.
As an attention check, they were also asked to press the space bar as quickly as possible whenever a fixation cross was presented in the center of the screen.
After the study phase, half of participants first gave post-study ratings of all 40 CSs and then engaged in the valence-memory task (i.e., TBS, VMA, or 3ACE); the other half completed the tasks in the reverse order (i.e., valence-memory task first, ratings second).
After the valence-memory task instructions were given, participants' understanding was probed as in Experiment 2.
<!-- Participants were presented with several instruction-check items. -->
<!-- Each item described a scenario (e.g., "you remember that the given CS was presented with a pleasant US") and asked participants to respond according to the instruction they had just read. -->
<!-- In case of erroneous responses to one or more instruction-check items, instructions were presented and probed again (up to a total of 3 times); participants with errors in the last round were excluded from analyses. -->
The respective valence-memory task commenced after instruction checks were completed; afterwards, half of participants completed the post-learning evaluative ratings for the 40 CSs.
For exploratory purposes, we subsequently presented participants with another valence-memory task (VMA or TBS), followed by a US-identity memory task (see above).
Finally, participants were asked whether they paid attention during the learning phase, whether they thought their data should be analyzed for scientific purposes (or were subpar for any reason), and about the setting in which they completed the study (in the lab; alone in a quiet setting; a quiet setting with other people; with other people and occasional interruptions; a lively environment with frequent interruptions).

## Discussion

Across tasks, robust EC effects were found for Memory-set responses and memory attributions, and EC effects were clearly absent for Attitude-set responses and random-guessing attributions.
This pattern of results is in line with those of Experiments 1 and 2, which also found an EC effect when participants felt they remembered US valence, but not when participants felt they did not remember.
These results support the robustness of the conclusions derived from the TBS task.
In particular, the same results are obtained regardless of whether nonpaired and valent stimuli are included in the design or not.
Note that, with nonpaired and valent items included, the TBS is a much more powerful tool, especially for investigating the attitude-as-information bias and possibly other heuristics.  

Regarding gut-feeling (or intuition) attributions, results diverged between @waroquier_distinguishing_2020's Valence Memory Attribution (VMA) task and the 3ACE task we introduced in Experiment 3: 
While the evidence for or against an EC effect with gut-feeling attributions was inconclusive in the VMA, the 3ACE yielded positive evidence for such a gut-feeling EC effect. 
The present evidence for the absence of EC in the absence of remembering US valence contrasts with the finding of EC for "random guessing" cases in Waroquier et al.'s (2020) Experiment 2 (both in the immediate and delayed test) as well as in a meta-analysis of their Experiments 1 and 2.
Given that our study is a close replication of the studies by Waroquier, we can only speculate about the reasons for the discrepancy (i.e., there were differences in participant populations, US stimuli, language of instructions); more research is needed to try to replicate their EC effect for random-guessing attributions and to explain why the current Experiment 3 failed to do so.
With regard to the "intuition" attributions, our findings are more in line with those by Waroquier et al., who also found inconclusive evidence for these cases (i.e., there was evidence for feeling-based EC in Exp.1, but evidence was inconclusive in the immediate test of Exp.2, and there was evidence for the absence of EC on the delayed test).
Interestingly, we found an EC effect for "intuition" attributions in the 3ACE task in which attributions and evaluative ratings were collected in a single task (hence better respecting the immediacy criterion than the VMA task).
To identify the factors underlying a potential "intuitive" or "gut-feeling" EC effect, future research should aim at better understanding the subjective state of gut-feeling attributions, and its relation to similar subjective memory reports (such as "know" judgments that are often associated with familiarity-based or semantic memory retrieval).


# General Discussion

<!-- Here we first summarize the main insights of the new conditional judgment procedure. -->
<!-- Next, we discuss its limitations, and explain how the TBS can be further improved and used to advance research on attitudes and beyond. -->

<!-- ## Main findings -->

The present research introduced a new conditional judgment procedure - the TBS task - for advancing the study of (potential) EC effects without feelings of remembering US valence. 
In the empirical section, we validated this new task, and we additionally used it to deliver preliminary results on attitude-as-information biases typically found in EC studies interested in memory, as well as on the question of EC effects in the absence of feelings of remembering US valence. 
In this General Discussion, we first discuss the main findings observed here in light of these main objectives.
Next, we will address the limitations of the novel approach, and explain how it can be further improved and used to advance research on attitudes and beyond.

### Validity of TBS task

Our primary aim was to test the validity of the TBS task.
In two experiments, we influenced memory by pairing some stimuli with USs, while other stimuli were never paired with USs; and we influenced attitudes by using stimuli pre-rated as pleasant or unpleasant.
The manipulations of pairing memory were reflected in participants' metacognitive judgments (i.e., their use of the Memory-set vs. Attitude-set), as well as their valence-memory reports when they used the Memory set.
The manipulations of attitudes were reflected in participants' pleasantness judgments when they used the Attitude set.
Experiment 3 further supported the robustness of conclusions derived from the TBS: similar conclusions about EC effects without feelings of remembering US valence were obtained when excluding (the otherwise informative) nonpaired and valent stimuli from the design. 
These results confirm a successful validation of the TBS task [comparable to that of the process-dissociation procedure by @hutter_dissociating_2012].


### Evaluative conditioning and feelings of remembering

A more secondary aim was to use the TBS to provide preliminary information about whether EC requires feelings of remembering US valence.
Using the TBS task, we collected CS-level data on evaluations in the absence of feelings of remembering US valence. 
While CS evaluations in the absence of feelings of remembering US valence reflected preexisting attitudes (attesting to their validity), they were however consistently unaffected by US valence.
To the contrary, we found evidence for the *absence* of EC effects when participants felt they did not remember US valence.

This result is largely in line with results from the process-dissociation task as summarized by a recent meta-analysis of PD studies [@mierop_does_2018].
Across 12 PD studies [@mierop_does_2018], this analysis yielded an overall mean estimate of *A*=.07, 95% CI [.04, .11].
First, this is a relatively small effect; it corresponds to approximately 1 out of the 24 CSs typically presented to a given participant being governed by the "EC in the absence of memory" branch of the MPT model.
^[With estimates of *M* around .5, valence memory was present for about half of the CSs (i.e., 12 out of 24); of the remaining half, an average of 7% of responses was found to be consistent with the "EC-without-memory" pattern (i.e., 7% of 12 CSs amounts to less than 1 CS).]
Second, the meta-analysis also revealed substantial heterogeneity (*I*² = 56%), reflecting the fact that the confidence interval of *A* excluded zero in 5 out of 12 studies, whereas it included zero in the remaining 7 studies.
In sum, while PD studies yield some meta-analytic evidence for the persistence of EC effects in the absence of US-valence memory, the effect is small and contingent on unknown enabling conditions.
Given sample sizes comparable to (and, jointly, considerably larger than) previous studies, the present null results are unlikely to reflect lack of power. 
Indeed, Bayes Factors indicate evidence for the absence of even small effects.
It remains possible, of course, that EC without remembering US valence will be found in other studies that realize (as yet elusive) critical enabling conditions.

The finding of no EC without feelings of remembering US valence is fully in line with previous conclusions obtained with per-item procedures that also found no EC when participants indicated not remembering the valence of the paired US [e.g., @stahl_respective_2009].
It is however at odds with a recent per-item result by @waroquier_distinguishing_2020 showing EC even when participants indicated having randomly guessed whether the US's valence was positive or negative.
In the present Experiment 3, we failed to replicate the latter finding. 
However, assuming that the findings by Waroquier et al. can be replicated in future studies, there are three important differences between the TBS and their approach that could account for the inconsistent result patterns.
First, while the present TBS task allowed for only two different metacognitive states (i.e., participants could report either remembering or not-remembering), the task used by Waroquier et al. required a finer distinction of three or four metacognitive states (i.e., memory, intuition, familiarity, random guessing).
On the one hand, such a fine-grained distinction may put too high a demand on participants, especially if instructions fail to clearly explain the different states [for a discussion in the context of the related Remember/Know procedure see @migo_measuring_2012]. 
On the other hand, a finer-grained distinction may be required to validly tap relevant metacognitive states [e.g., structural vs. judgment knowledge, @dienes_unconscious_1995; @dienes_measuring_2005].
Second, in Waroquier et al.'s studies, the EC effect was assessed using a continuous rating scale, whereas a binary choice was used in the present TBS studies; the former may capture more subtle effects and could therefore be more sensitive than the latter method.
As a final difference, while in the TBS task participants reported their metacognitive state simultaneously with the pleasant/unpleasant judgment, valence-memory and metacognitive attribution were assessed in separate trials (Exp. 1) or even in separate blocks (Exp. 2) in the studies by Waroquier et al. (2020).
With a delay between judgments, their metacognitive measure met the immediacy criterion less well than the present TBS task.
One may, therefore, speculate that their results reflect the addition of noise to the evaluation-memory relation, which could lead to an artificial "EC without feelings of remembering US valence" pattern.
Future task developments could move towards a task such as the 3ACE used in Experiment 3 that respects the immediacy criterion, allows for more than two attributions (e.g., that distinguishes not only memory and no-memory states but also allows for intuition attributions), and uses a more sensitive response format (i.e., a continuous rating scale rather than a binary choice).

The finding of an EC effect for gut-feeling attributions in the 3ACE points to the possibility of EC in the absence of feelings of remembering US valence.
It remains open whether these findings reflect some participants' conservative decision criteria (i.e., a tendency to respond "intuition" for somewhat weaker remember experiences) or a distinct process altogether.
Clearly, however, this finding (if robust) will be important both for research into the processes underlying evaluative memories as well as for applied research targeting strategies for controlling persuasive influences.

Whether, when, and through which processes EC effects can be found in the absence of feelings of remembering US valence bears important theoretical implications. 
The evaluative conditioning literature distinguishes between Stimulus-Stimulus and Stimulus-Response evaluative learning models. Stimulus-Stimulus models assume that CS-US links are encoded in memory and that their retrieval influences participants' judgments at the decision stage [e.g., @stahl_evaluative_2018; @aust_memory-based_2019]. 
For these models, EC effects are contingent upon a successful retrieval of the CS-US pairings from memory. 
Alternatively, Stimulus-Response models assume that the affective responses elicited by the US (rather than the US as such) are linked to the CS in long-term memory [for a recent discussion, see @corneille_associative_2019; see also @jones_implicit_2009; @sweldens_evaluative_2010]. 
For these models, CS exposure directly cues the learned affective response. 
Hence, neither the encoding nor the retrieval of a CS-US pairing is required to observe EC effects.

Stimulus-Response learning is thought to operate via a "direct transfer" of the US valence to the CS [e.g., @hutter_dissociating_2018; @sweldens_evaluative_2010] or via implicit misattribution. The latter is thought to occur when, at the learning stage, participants mistakenly attribute their affective response to the CS instead of attributing it to the US [e.g., @jones_implicit_2009]. 
In turn, implicit misattribution processes are expected to operate under specific conditions that are conducive to confusability about the source of one's affective reaction [e.g., @jones_implicit_2009; @hutter_implicit_2013]. 
These conditions were not met in the learning paradigms used for the present research. 
Recent evaluative conditioning research, however, casts doubts on the existence of stimulus-response learning in more conducive conditions. 
In particular, evidence for unaware EC effects in the original paradigm [@olson_implicit_2001], failed to be supported in more recent studies that relied on this paradigm [@moran_incidental_2020, Kurdi et al., 2022]. 
Another piece of evidence for stimulus-response learning, relating to source confusability, was also compromised in recent studies. 
Specifically, implicit misattribution assumes stronger EC effects when US valence is mild rather than high. 
This is because a very valent US is unlikely to elicit confusion about the source of one's affective reaction. 
Recent research failed to find evidence consistent with this rationale [@mierop_does_2018].
Finally, that a memory-independent parameter has been found in instruction-based procedures [@hutter_examining_2017-1] further challenges an associative interpretation of the findings [for related demonstrations, see also @bmc_amb_relat_2022; @corneille_evidence_2019].

### Affect-as-information bias

When participants lack US valence memory, they may use their evaluations to inform their memory judgments; in that case, a potential "EC without memory" effect is masked.
To circumvent this problem, per-item tasks have asked participants to indicate when they do not remember US valence (e.g., by responding "I don't remember"), and the process-dissociation and TBS tasks have asked them to report their attitudes (instead of US valence memory) whenever they feel they do not remember.
However, more recently it was found that attitude-as-information bias may also affect metacognitive "remember" states [@bar-anan_effect_2014; @bar-anan_evaluative_2010], and here we assessed whether this is the case also for US valence memory judgments in the TBS task.
In support of this possibility, Memory-set judgments of nonpaired foil stimuli were affected by participants' attitudes towards these stimuli.

Thus, attitude-as-information bias was obtained for cases for which participants had a certain amount of confidence in their memory, as they indicated remembering US valence (i.e., used Memory-set responses on the TBS task), and despite the option to refrain from reporting US valence memory (i.e., they could have reported an Attitude-set or "don't remember" response).
These observations are at odds with the suggestion that the attitude-as-information bias stems from a heuristic used under uncertainty that is linked to forced responding; instead, they are consistent with findings reported by Bar-Anan et al. (2010, 2014) suggesting that cases of attitude-consistent responding may be experienced, subjectively, as true remembering.
<!-- Thus, rather than reflecting a heuristic such as “I don’t remember the US, but I like the CS so it must have been paired with a pleasant US”, this phenomenon may reflect a different kind of attitude-as-information bias. One possibility is a heuristic in which the feeling of having a clear evaluation of a stimulus (regardless of its valence) is misattributed as a feeling of remembering of (or strong familiarity with) the stimulus.  -->
<!-- Such a bias would be ecologically plausible in the sense that one's (positive or negative) evaluations are often accompanied with, or result from, (pleasant or unpleasant) experiences. -->
<!-- The misattribution of pre-existing attitudes to a particular recent experiences may pose a threat to the validity of metacognitive judgments in guiding strategies to control our behavior. -->
<!-- If we tend to falsely believe that our attitudes towards an object stem from a specific recent experiential source, then we may discount our (valid) attitudes and could allow less reliable sources of information guide our behaviors. -->
Additional research is needed to address this intriguing phenomenon, as well as its consequences for the controllability of evaluative-conditioning influences on attitudes and behavior.


## Limitations and open questions

The TBS is limited in that it (1) addresses only deliberate evaluations, (2) distinguishes only two metacognitive states, and (3) addresses only a very specific issue.
Here we discuss these limitations and sketch possible ways to address them in future developments.
Before we do so, it is important to highlight that both the TBS and Hütter et al.'s PD procedure taps awarenes of knowing rather than intentional control.

### Intentional control versus awareness of knowing

Researchers familiar with the literature on process dissociation, which capitalizes on the notion of (un)intentional control, may be hesitant to conclude that the TBS task is indeed an improvement upon the PD approach.
Tapping the ability to intentionally control information is critical in many traditional process-dissociation tasks, which typically aim at dissociating two distinct contributions to behavior, only one of which is under intentional control.
The inclusion-exclusion instruction manipulates how the controllable process is mapped onto the set of responses, and it is assumed that the uncontrollable process affects responses in the same way in both instruction conditions.
In other words, participants in process-dissociation tasks can only reverse the response assignment in the exclusion condition for intentionally controllable information; the response pattern remains unaffected by the instruction manipulation insofar as there are also uncontrollable contributions.

In the present research, instead of intentional control, awareness of knowing is of central interest. 
Per-item measures of valence memory require judgment knowledge (i.e., whether a CS had been paired with positive or negative USs), as well as their awareness of knowing (i.e., participants are asked to respond 'dont know' if they are unaware of any knowledge).
The TBS similarly taps these two aspects of awareness, albeit in a slightly different way (i.e., it asks participants to report their attitude if they are not aware of having any knowledge).
For both per-item and TBS tasks, we assume that knowledge about one's subjective knowledge state (i.e., being aware of having knowledge or not) can be used intentionally (i.e., participants intentionally select whether to report their memory or their attitude).

Importantly, controlling the use of a piece of information or knowledge is not the same as being aware of knowing it (i.e., control may be possible for unconscious knowledge, that is, for which awareness of knowing is lacking; it is also conceivable, at least, that awareness of knowledge may be present in some situations while that knowledge uncontrollably affects a specific task). 
Hence, if the TBS and the PD approach as applied to assessing EC without memory by Hütter et al. (2012) were to capture distinct features of consciousness, this might explain different patterns of results (and would prohibit presenting the TBS task as an improvement of Hütter et al.'s PD approach).

However, while it may generally be possible to control the use of unconscious information strategically (i.e., in the absence of awareness of knowing), this does not characterize the PD task as it is applied to EC by Hütter et al. (2012).
Participants in their PD task also require awareness of knowing as well as judgment knowledge in order to follow instructions: 
To be able to select the relevant part of the instruction (i.e., to report memories or attitudes), participants have to decide whether, subjectively, they have knowledge or not (i.e., they need awareness of their knowledge); to be able to report their attitude (or memory), they require judgment knowledge (i.e., regarding whether a CS had been paired with positive or negative USs). 
Importantly, this knowledge must be under their intentional control, so that they can follow the respective inclusion or exclusion instruction (i.e., report veridical versus reversed attitudes or memories).
This is highlighted by the fact that Hütter et al. proposed two exchangeable versions of their task, one in which instructions require reversal of memory judgments, and another in which instructions require reversal of attitude judgments (although we have discussed here only the more widely used attitude-exclusion variant). 
In this sense, the PD approach to assessing EC without memory is not a traditional PD paradigm that capitalizes on (un)controllability of (in this case) attitudinal information --- to the contrary, it assumes and requires attitudinal information to be controlled.
It hinges on the subjective assessment of having (versus not having) conscious knowledge about CS-US pairings; it is this subjective awareness of (not) knowing that determines whether a response is reversed or not.
^[This interpretation is in line with Waroquier et al. (2020) who have also pointed to the subjective nature of Hütter et al.'s (2012) PD task. It is important to note, however, that the PD approach is not fully subjective: The model parameters provided by Hütter et al. (2012) reflect not only the subjective assessment of having memory but also its accuracy, and not only the assessment of having an attitude towards a CS in the absence of memory, but an attitude in the direction of the valence of the US that was paired with that CS.]


### Deliberate memory retrieval and evaluations

The TBS relies on deliberate evaluations; results and conclusions may differ when so-called "implicit" attitude measures are used; and future research is needed to relate the results of direct and indirect measurement approaches. 
It is unclear, however, on which basis "explicit" and "implicit" attitude measures should be distinguished from each other. 
At present, the distinction reflects social convention rather than being grounded in a compelling empirical or theoretical rationale  [for a thorough discussion, see @corneille_implicit_2020].
If "implicit" is understood as "automatic", then the TBS clearly allowed for the influence of unconscious (memory) processes. 
This is also true for deliberate evaluations used in Process Dissociation studies.
We note that the TBS could be adapted for addressing other features of automaticity, such as efficient responding, for example by requesting speeded evaluations.

Relatedly, the TBS explicitly asks participants whether they felt they remembered the CS-US pairings; this instruction should induce them to try to retrieve their memory for the pairings.
What we found is that EC is only observed when participants felt they remembered US valence.
However, it is possible that participants would show EC effects without such feelings of remembering, if they were not explicitly asked to retrieve the valence of the USs paired with the CSs.
In other words, whereas EC may require CS-US pairing memory, it may not in all circumstances require feelings of remembering of those memories at the time of CS evaluations.
This theoretical possibility could be tested, for instance, with the help of indirect measures of memory in future studies.

Another question is whether different conclusions may be reached when using physiological measures. 
For instance, studies have claimed successful subliminal conditioning for salivating response but not for evaluations [@passarelli_augmenting_2022]. 
Although recent research suggests the involvement of convergent evaluative learning processes for behavioral (direct or indirect) and physiological measures [@corneille_behavioral_2020], one should be open to the possibility that different learning or decision making processes are operating when specific physiological responses, or specific populations, are under consideration. 
Likewise, one may speculate that behavioral measures capitalizing on preference rather than absolute evaluative judgments [@amd_dissociating_2020] may be more sensitive to memory-independent processes [but see @heycke_subliminal_2017]. 
Finally, one should be careful not generalizing the conclusions reached here in the context of evaluative conditioning to other forms of learning from pairings, such as reward learning [@leganes-fonteneau_avoiding_2021].

### Coarse metacognitive distinction

The TBS distinguishes between only two different metacognitive states (i.e., having feelings of remembering or not); it does not allow participants to report other metacognitive states.
In particular, several important dissociations have been made in previous research, for instance between remembering versus knowing [@wixted_continuous_2010], or structural versus judgment knowledge [@dienes_measuring_2005]. 
The TBS task is however easily extended to allow for more fine-grained metacognitive distinctions.
For instance, an adapted version (such as the 3ACE task piloted in Experiment 3) could offer three attribution options (one each for feelings of remembering, gut feeling, and guessing) to more conclusively assess whether the results obtained by @waroquier_distinguishing_2020 reflect an artifact due to lack of immediacy, or whether their more fine-grained metacognitive distinctions were better able to isolate the relevant cases than the present TBS task.
The EC effect for gut-feeling/intuition attributions found on the 3ACE (which respects the immediacy criterion better than Waroquier et al.'s task) points to the latter.
More research is needed to understand better when and why EC effects could be obtained without feelings of remembering.

### Going beyond the EC-without-feelings-of-remembering issue

The TBS task was used here for addressing one very specific research question in attitude research, but the task (or the general conditional-judgment approach) may be adapted for addressing other, similarly structured questions.
For instance, there is a related issue in research on truth judgments, which depend on participants' memory for the statement in question:
It is typically found that truth judgments are higher for old, repeated statements than for new ones [@dechene_truth_2009]. 
The TBS task could be adapted to assess perceived truth instead of pleasantness, and separate truth judgments in the presence versus absence of feelings of remembering. 
Previous research has suggested that it is not the factual repetition that increases truth judgments, but that instead a perceived repetition (i.e., a false alarm) is sufficient to increase truth judgments [@bacon_credibility_1979; see also @mattavelli_truth_2021].
In addition to providing a simple assessment of metamemory status, a parallel application of the TBS task to truth judgments could also help investigate whether similar judgment biases affect both types of ratings (e.g., whether statements perceived as more true are also more likely to be judged 'remembered').
Likewise, mere exposure effects may be revisited using the TBS. 
In mere exposure studies, stimuli are preferred when participants have processed them earlier relative to when they are novel [@zajonc_attitudinal_1968]. 
Many studies have supported the view that this preference may arise independently of a conscious recollection of the old status of the item [@zajonc_mere_2001], or even be compromised by conscious recollection [e.g., @bornstein_stimulus_1992; @newell_recognising_2007; @whittlesea_implicit_2001]. 
Here too, the use of the TBS may be useful for shedding complementary light on these questions.
Finally, recent findings in the literature on artifical grammar learning (AGL) have found evidence for EC in the absence of awareness of knowing [@jurchis_evaluative_2020].
In that study, awareness of knowing and EC were assessed using separate tasks; hence, the result is potentially susceptible to a lack of immediacy.
It would be interesting to test whether the finding can be replicated in a variant of the TBS task applied to the AGL paradigm.


## Conclusions and outlook

Studying the relation between EC effects and memory for CS-US pairings informs current (evaluative) learning models.
It also bears significant practical implications; for instance, regarding the controllability of persuasive influences in consumer behavior.
Here, we introduced and validated a novel conditional-judgment approach (the TBS task) for advancing the understanding of how EC effects relate to feelings of remembering US valence.
We argued that the novel approach combines the advantages of the previous per-item and process-dissociation approaches while overcoming some of their limitations.
Beyond our primary validation goal, we used the TBS to obtain preliminary insights into EC effects without feelings of remembering US valence and into attitude-as-information effects. 
We found evidence against the former. In addition, we found evidence for attitude-as-information effects when participants felt they remembered US valence, suggesting that the use of this heuristic is not contingent on memory uncertainty. 
We also illustrated how the conditional-judgment rationale underlying the TBS task may be adapted to address outstanding research questions of contemporary interest.
